Develop a C++ program that generates a formatted report using various I/O manipulators. The program will simulate a simple data processing task where it reads data from variables, processes it, and displays it in a formatted manner.
Requirements:

    Data Initialization:
        Initialize variables representing different data types (int, double, string).
        Include at least one integer (e.g., an ID number), one floating-point number (e.g., a balance), and one string (e.g., a name).

    Tasks to Perform:
        Display a title for the report using manipulators to center the text on the console.
        Display column headers for ID, Name, and Balance. Ensure that each header is aligned with its respective data column below.
        Use manipulators to format the ID as a five-digit integer padded with zeros.
        Format the Balance to show currency (assume USD) with two decimal places, aligned properly under the Balance column.
        Display at least three rows of data using the initialized variables.

                           Daily Report
ID       Name             Balance
-----    ------------     ----------
00001    Alice            $1000.00
00002    Bob              $530.25
00003    Charlie          $2040.50

 
Instructions:

    Write the program in C++ and use the specified manipulators to achieve the formatting requirements.
    Ensure that your code is well-commented to explain the use of each manipulator.
    Test your program to make sure that it handles different values correctly and that the output remains consistent and well-formatted regardless of the input.
